										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market has been experiencing significant volatility, with the Bitcoin price leading the charge. Over the past month, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-slides-to-94000-after-cpi-surprise-will-the-downtrend-continue/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">BTC has been trading sideways</a>, recording declines that have pushed its value below the $100,000 mark. As analysts speculate about the cryptocurrency’s next major move, recent data suggests that a classic Flag Pole pattern is beginning to emerge on the Bitcoin price chart. The crypto analyst who has identified this pattern has shared a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-roadmap-to-117000/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">bullish roadmap prediction</a> for Bitcoin, projecting that it could rise to a new all-time high above $120,000.</p>
<p>In a TradingView analysis, crypto expert Weslad expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s future trajectory,<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/4Bupxf6u-BTC-s-Next-Move-Mapped-Out-Don-t-Miss-This-Breakout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"> projecting</a> that it could soar as high as $120,843 in this bull cycle. The analyst highlighted the current formation of a classic <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-move-to-new-targets/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Flag Pole pattern</a> on the BTC price chart. The emergence of this distinct technical pattern in the Bitcoin structure has sparked an enthusiastic response from analysts, as they anticipate a massive breakout to the upside. </p>
<h2>Roadmap To $120,000 Bitcoin Price Target</h2>
<p>According to the TradingView analyst’s chart, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-rejection/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Bitcoin price faced a rejection</a> at an external supply area after experiencing an impressive 27% rally from a strong external demand zone between $$85,300 and $86,800. This rejection was a critical moment for the cryptocurrency, as it sparked the creation of what many experts call a perfect <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-bull-flag-psychology/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Bull Flag formation</a>. </p>
<p>This bull flag pattern is typically known as a bullish continuation signal during an uptrend. It represents a halt in a cryptocurrency’s upward movement before the trend resumes. In the case of Bitcoin, Weslad suggests that its recent rejection is not viewed as a downturn but rather as a smart money accumulation zone designed to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shake-out-sents-price-from-102k-to-92k-heres-why/amp/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">shake out weaker hands</a> who panic during market declines. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-recalc-dims="1" class="size-large wp-image-695632" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bitcoin-chart-from-Weslad.jpg?w=512&amp;resize=512%2C297" alt="Bitcoin" width="512" height="297" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Despite its pullback, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-action-in-the-next-30-days/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Bitcoin’s recent price action </a>has demonstrated a strong resilience in an immediate demand zone between $91,000 and $95,000. The analyst also describes this correction as a “fake down,” noting that it was due to liquidity engineering. This strategic liquidity grab allows <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-accumulation-ramps-up-investors-scoop-4-16-billion-in-four-days/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">large players to accumulate BTC</a> at favourable prices before the next significant move upward.</p>
<p>While noting the Flag Pole formation, Weslad also highlights a recent breakout from a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-descending-triangle/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Descending Channel </a>that has previously restricted Bitcoin’s price movements. This channel breakout signals the possible resurgence of Bitcoin’s bullishness, with the analyst predicting an initial surge to $108,089. </p>
<p>If Bitcoin can <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-stuck-below-100k/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">maintain a positive momentum</a>, the pathway to an ultimate Flag Pole target of $120,843 becomes plausible.</p>
<h2>Monitoring Breakout Signals</h2>
<p>While Weslad projects a new all-time high for Bitcoin at $120,843, the analyst also emphasizes important signals that could indicate an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-faces-resistance-103k/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener  nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">imminent breakout</a>. He revealed that if Bitcoin can successfully flip the aforementioned external supply zone between $108,000 and $109,000, the cryptocurrency could see its price skyrocket to new highs.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $96,142, marking a 2.25% decline over the past week.</p>
